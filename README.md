# ugnis-script

Problems with javascript:
  - too many edge cases
  - multiple ways to do the same thing
  - functional programming is hard to read and understand

Problems with application building:
  - dataflow is hard to track
  - defining components is verbose
  
ugnis-script goals:
  - be a close subset of javascript - reduce clutter and edge cases
  - make functional programming more readable
  - make dataflow easy to understand and visualize
  - typesafety
  - no magic
  - be the best interface for html, webgl and node programming

ugnis-script details:
  - typesafety without users specifying types
  - every value is a constant
  - every value is reactive
  - there are no keywords

ideas
    all values are reactive
    no keywords (all keywords are generated by imported modules)
    one file only

#TODO:
Docs:
  - more examples
  - definitions

UX improvements:
  -

Features:
  - fetch
  - import components
  - animations and timers

Performance
  - remove virtual dom, because we know how components use state, we don't need virtual dom.
  - tail call optimisation
