Ugnis is a visual component builder.

Ugnis consist of three parts:
  - your component as a JSON file.
  - a runtime that interprets your JSON and mounts it on a provided html node.
  - Ugnis visual editor because you wouldn't want to write JSON by hand.

# How to use it

To create your first component use our online editor TODO LINK or download the editor TODO LINK

if you don't want to download a packaged desktop app, you can use a website version via npm:
```bash
  npm install ugnis-editor

  node node_modules/.bin/ugnis-editor PORT=3000 PATH=./ugnis_modules #defaults
```

Once you create a component you can add it to your website
TODO CDN

or by installing:
```bash
    npm install ugnis
```

and mounting a component:
```javascript
  import ugnis from 'ugnis'

  const component = ugnis(htmlNode, json, defaultState)
```

If you are integrating Ugnis into an existing app, you can interact by sending and listening to events:
```javascript
 component.emitEvent(eventName, data, nativeEvent)

 component.addListener((eventName, data, nativeEvent, previousState, currentState, mutations)=>{

 })
```

## Integrating with react
For react projects there is a special wrapper component
```
    npm install ugnis-react # you don't need to npm install ugnis
```

```javascript
  import Ugnis from 'ugnis-react'

  const component = (props) =>
    <Ugnis
        definition={json}
        defaultState={defaultState}
        onMount={function(definition, vdom, currentState, render, emitEvent, addListener){}}/>
```

# Goals
Goals (must be reached before releasing 1.0v)
  - [x] zero configuration, new apps don't need webpack or babel.
  - [ ] editor works well on mobile
  - [x] play nice with existing apps, can be introduced in small steps.
  - [x] powerful enough to write any application, Ugnis is written with Ugnis itself
  - [ ] scalable for humans - show connections between state, events and view nodes,
        no need to go through thousands of line of code to build the mental mode, no need to grep action names.
  - [ ] scalable for machines - application splitting by default
  - [ ] server side rendering
  - [ ] typesafe - there should be no runtime errors
  - [ ] speed - Ugnis knows how view nodes are connected with the state, there is no actual need to use virtual dom

Problems with javascript:
  - too many edge cases
  - multiple ways to do the same thing
  - functional programming is hard to read and understand

Problems with application building:
  - dataflow is hard to track
  - defining components is verbose
  
ugnis-script goals:
  - be a close subset of javascript - reduce clutter and edge cases
  - make functional programming more readable
  - make dataflow easy to understand and visualize
  - typesafety
  - no magic
  - be the best interface for html, webgl and node programming

ugnis-script details:
  - typesafety without users specifying types
  - every value is a constant
  - every value is reactive
  - there are no keywords

ideas
    all values are reactive
    no keywords (all keywords are generated by imported modules)
    one file only

#TODO:
Docs:
  - more examples
  - definitions

UX improvements:
  -

Features:
  - fetch
  - import components
  - animations and timers

Performance
  - remove virtual dom, because we know how components use state, we don't need virtual dom.
  - tail call optimisation

#License:

MIT. Also, for .json files, the standard JSON license applies, so "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil".
Keep in mind, that every Ugnis application is a .json file.
