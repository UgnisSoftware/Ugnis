# ugnis-script

Problems with javascript:
  - too many edge cases
  - multiple ways to do the same thing
  - functional programming is hard to read and understand

Problems with application building:
  - dataflow is hard to track
  - defining components is verbose
  
ugnis-script goals:
  - be a subscript of javascript - reduce clutter and edge cases
  - make functional programming more readable
  - make every value reactive
  - typesafety
  - be the best interface for html, webgl and node programming

ugnis-script details:
  - typesafety without users specifying types
  - every value is a constant
  - every value is reactive
